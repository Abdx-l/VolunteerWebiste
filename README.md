# VolunteerWebiste

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key features of this project include a blog page, web scraper, Firebase integration, and a user profile page. This work was equally split with the user https://github.com/Towaiji.

JavaScript Features:
Web Scraper: Developed using the Puppeteer API, this scraper collects data from multiple pages on "https://www.volunteermatch.org/", including the title, application link, and location of each opportunity. This data is saved to a CSV file and accessed in the HTML file.
Firebase Integration: Sets up authentication and Firestore services, listens for authentication state changes to update the user's profile with their name, email, and profile picture, and fetches additional user data from Firestore if available. If no user is signed in, it alerts them and redirects them to the login page. Manages login form submissions using email and password, and handles errors appropriately.

HTML Features:
Structure: Creates buttons, navbars, and displays JavaScript features.
Opportunities Page: Includes a search filter to filter through available opportunities by location and name.
Contact Page: Displays a simple contact form, a map showing the "office" location, and links to the company's "social media accounts".

CSS Features:
Styling: Positions elements correctly, adds colour to the website, and changes the main font for a cohesive look.
This project showcases various front-end development skills and highlights the collaborative effort with Towaiji.
